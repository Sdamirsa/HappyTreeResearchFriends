Self-authorship is the **ability to define** one's own beliefs, identity, and relationships based on internal values rather than external pressures. 
Becoming a self-author involves developing a **strong internal voice** to guide decisions and actions across cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal domains. 
This involves four stages, and the cycle then repeats, with each iteration deepening your self-authorship. 
1. Planning
2. Doing
3. Evaluating
4. Using Feedback for Improvement

Decision-making is a common challenge for my mentees, so this guide will introduce you to the basics and help you complete your first cycle successfully.
