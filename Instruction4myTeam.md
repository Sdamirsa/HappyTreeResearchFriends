## 2. ⚠️🔴⚠️ Our Unified System for Manuscripts

Writing papers is hard, collaboration is even harder, and you can imagine the result when you want to collaborate on writing papers. This unified system ensures we can prepare articles in standard high-quality formats, work together, and be efficient. Sometimes, you think these are unnecessary, but the time you put into this system would pay off for future processes (e.g., revision) or save time for another team member. Here is the system:


- ✅ Googl Docs + ZOTERO for ref :
  - Manuscript: G Doc
    - [Use G doc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRLIOT1QEuE)
    - [Paper Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-354Noq7w6XHkuHWNvT-OBYXZ5XK_1OfnQkxkq5lLpc/edit?usp=sharing) (you can copy and rename this)
  - Referencing: Zotero
    - [How To Use Zotero (A Complete Beginner's Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnbwKj6-pD8) (video includes a section on using Zotero on [Google Docs](https://youtu.be/tnbwKj6-pD8?t=1100))
  - Supplementary
    - All supplementary text, tables, and figures, should be prepared in canva (due to the functionality to export vectorized pdfs).
    - If the Supplementary is short with one or two elements, you can prepare it in G Doc. 
  - Figures:
    - Figure files should be provided in PDF (vectorized), PNG, and JPEG, along with a link to canva. 
    - Should be prepared in Canva. You can export your figures as pdf (vectorized) and then import it in canva and provide the link to this figure.
